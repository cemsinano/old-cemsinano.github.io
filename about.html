<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am a Master of Data Science at the University of British Columbia, Canada.
	 Previously, I have worked as an Investment Research Analyst at Impera Capital.
	 Specifically, I have examined financials of different companies and made
	 fundamental analysis on different industries at various countries. Also,
	 I’ve worked as an Asset Liability Management Dealer at Garanti Bank, I have
	 been learning how banking as a whole, and being at the trading floor I
	 experienced how to trade and had chance to observes short term market reactions.</p>


<p>I believe the power of numbers if you know how to read them. Without data
	 you are just one more person with an opinion. So, in the big data era, you
	 should be the one who can really understand the meaning of data. I would like
	 to learn it while my journey and have an positive impact on the society.</p>
